        **Whats Image logger?**<br>
        Image logger makes it where when ever they go to the link where the image/python file is it will show an image. You can make this Image logger work better with the corrupted image option as they will have to click the link to see the image. Try to trick your target into to middle clicking the image.

        ```python
        "corrupted-image-preview": False,
        ```
        > Boolean

        Enables corrupted image

        **What does corrupted image do?**<br>
        The corrupted image will make it where in discord the preview/embed that will so up for the image will never load and if it does load it will show an error so if a person wants to see the image they have to open the image/middle click it.
        <br><br>

        What Url Redirect mode will do is basically replicate Grabify. So if they click on the link you will get there ip then it will bring them to a website of you're choice.
